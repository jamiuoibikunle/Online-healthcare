<h2>About</h2>
HackwithIo22-BooQiT was developed as a competition in the GDSC_UI 2022 hackathon. The application aims to solve the problem of waiting for too long during hospital visitations.
By using the application, patients can make appointments from the comfort of their phone at hospitals registeres on the application.

<h2>Current limitations</h2>
While the intention was for the application to be accessible to many clinics, patients can only make appointments at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, currently. Our team will work on adding this feature soon. The only reason we could not do that was because of the time constraint.

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
The application was built using React JS and Material UI for the User Interface, and Firebase for the backend.
